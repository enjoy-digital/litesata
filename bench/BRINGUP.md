# ECP5 SATA Bring-up Journal (ECPIX-5, issue #27)

Overnight autonomous bring-up session, 2026-07-24. Branch: `ecp5-v2`.
Hardware: ECPIX-5 85F (LFE5UM5G-85F), SSD on SATA connector (DCU1/CH0), FT2232 JTAG+UART.

## Legend
- Bitstream A = `bench/ecpix5.py --gen 1 --with-analyzer` (PHY only, OOB debug, uartbone 1Mbaud)
- Bitstream P = liteiclink `bench/serdes/ecpix5.py --linerate 1.5e9` (PRBS sanity, uartbone 115200)
- Bitstream B = A + `--with-bist` (Core/Crossbar/BIST)

## Journal

- 00:45 Sim suite green: 13 new ECP5 OOB tests + full regression (28 tests OK).
- 01:02 Build A: 18s wall, timing PASS (sys 100MHz: max 133MHz; sata_tx/rx 75MHz: max 231/253MHz).
  nextpnr accepts all DCU LDR/EI ports. Build P: 12s wall, PASS. Builds are cheap (~20s) — rebuild
  economy is a non-issue on these SoCMini designs.
- 01:05 [M0] Bitstream P loaded, uartbone OK (ident responds).
- 01:06 [M0] PRBS7 internal loopback 10s: BER 0 — but VACUOUS: serdes0_tx_ready=0/rx_ready=0,
  word-clock counters frozen. Init never completes on upstream liteiclink bench.
- 01:10 [M0] Fixed litescope_cli enum-row parsing bug (litescope repo, local commit needed).
  Litescope capture of init FSM: state=RESET-PCS-WAIT-RX-CDR-LOCK, tx_lol=0, rx_lol=1 (100% of
  1016 samples).
  CONCLUSION: TX PLL LOCKS at 1.5Gbps from the fabric-PLL 150MHz refclk (the critical half of
  M0). RX CDR cannot lock: SATA line is electrically idle (SSD waits for OOB) — expected, and
  exactly why the vendored SerdesInit was split into tx_ready/rx_ready with no rx_los exit.
  Risk #6 (rx_lol high until real data ⇒ phy.ready blocked) is CONFIRMED PLAUSIBLE: on bitstream
  A, watch whether ctrl's rx_cdrhold (SCI) clears rx_lol; else fall back to ready=tx_ready.
- 01:25 [M1] Bitstream A up: tx_ready=1 rx_ready=1 (risk #6 resolved: ctrl's SCI cdr_hold clears
  rx_lol on idle line). RX recorders: SSD sends spontaneous COMINITs (bursts 100-110ns, gaps
  320-330ns — textbook; RLOS resolves 100ns events cleanly, historic worry dead). But ctrl stuck
  in COMINIT: tx_cominit_ack never pulses.
- 01:35 [M1][ROOT-CAUSE-HUNT] TX word clock measured DEAD (0MHz) in every config; RX = 150MHz.
  Bisect: OOB hookups innocent (baseline identical to acorn-link DCU also dead). Full param diff
  vs Diamond-generated Lattice SERDES Eye Demo netlist (~/dev/google/ecp5_serdes/reference/pcs.v)
  → D_SYNC_LOCAL_EN="0b1" in every Diamond netlist, never set by liteiclink (defaults 0).
- 01:55 [M1][FIX] p_D_SYNC_LOCAL_EN="0b1" → TX word clock ALIVE: tx=149.7MHz rx=149.7MHz @gen2.
  Silent liteiclink bug since 2019 (TX PCLK dead on trellis builds at least on ECPIX-5/DCU1).
  Also learned: nextpnr ignores D_TX_MAX_RATE/CDR_MAX_RATE (Diamond-only); prjtrellis maps
  VCO_CK_DIV/DCO_CK_DIV/RATE_MODE/CMU params directly.
